# Task 010 Completion Report

**Task:** Zustand Store for Diagram State  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Version:** 0.1.22

---

## 📋 Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive Zustand store for managing diagram state with persist middleware, optimistic updates, and automatic rollback capabilities. The store now drives all canvas updates, eliminating local state management and providing a solid foundation for advanced features like undo/redo and real-time collaboration.

## ✅ Completed Items

### 1. Zustand Store Implementation
- ✅ Installed zustand@5.0.8 dependency
- ✅ Created comprehensive store at `src/lib/diagram/store.ts`
- ✅ Implemented persist middleware with localStorage
- ✅ Added state types: `DiagramState`, `PendingOperation`, `FailedOperation`
- ✅ Implemented complete node and edge CRUD operations
- ✅ Added viewport state management with persistence
- ✅ Integrated save state tracking (isSaving, lastSaved, saveError, hasUnsavedChanges)

### 2. Optimistic Updates & Rollback
- ✅ Implemented pending operations tracking with unique IDs
- ✅ Added timestamp tracking for all operations
- ✅ Stored previous state for rollback capability
- ✅ Implemented automatic rollback on API save failure
- ✅ Added failed operations logging with retry counts
- ✅ Created operation types: add, update, delete for nodes and edges

### 3. Performance-Optimized Selectors
- ✅ Created granular selectors to prevent unnecessary re-renders:
  - `useDiagramNodes` - selects only nodes
  - `useDiagramEdges` - selects only edges  
  - `useDiagramViewport` - selects only viewport
  - `useDiagramId` - selects diagram ID
  - `useIsSaving` - selects saving state
  - `useLastSaved` - selects last saved timestamp
  - `useSaveError` - selects save error
  - `useHasUnsavedChanges` - selects unsaved changes flag
  - `usePendingOperations` - selects pending operations
  - `useFailedOperations` - selects failed operations
  - `useDiagramActions` - selects all actions as one object

### 4. DiagramCanvas Integration
- ✅ Refactored DiagramCanvas to use Zustand store
- ✅ Replaced useNodesState/useEdgesState with store selectors
- ✅ Implemented proper initialization with refs
- ✅ Added viewport change tracking
- ✅ Enhanced save status indicators with unsaved changes detection
- ✅ Integrated optimistic update rollback on save failure
- ✅ Improved UI with better status messages and visual feedback

## 🛠️ Files Created/Modified

### Created Files:
- `src/lib/diagram/store.ts` - Comprehensive Zustand store with persist middleware, optimistic updates, and 460+ lines of state management logic

### Modified Files:
- `package.json` - Added zustand@5.0.8 dependency, updated version to 0.1.22
- `src/components/diagram/DiagramCanvas.tsx` - Refactored to use Zustand store, added viewport tracking, enhanced status panel with improved UX
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Added v0.1.22 entry with comprehensive task completion details

### Existing Files (No Changes Needed):
- `src/app/dashboard/diagrams/[id]/page.tsx` - Still provides initial data, no changes required
- `src/app/api/diagrams/[diagramId]/route.ts` - PUT endpoint remains unchanged

## 🧪 Testing Performed

### 1. Build Test
```bash
pnpm run build
✅ SUCCESS - Build completed successfully in 12.0s
- No TypeScript errors
- No linting errors
- All routes compiled correctly
- DiagramCanvas route: 58.1 kB (158 kB First Load JS)
```

### 2. Store Functionality Test
```bash
# Manual testing performed:
✅ SUCCESS - Store initializes correctly with diagram data
✅ SUCCESS - Node operations tracked in pending operations
✅ SUCCESS - Edge operations tracked in pending operations
✅ SUCCESS - Viewport changes persist to localStorage
✅ SUCCESS - Save state updates trigger UI changes
✅ SUCCESS - hasUnsavedChanges flag updates correctly
```

### 3. Optimistic Updates Test
```bash
# Manual testing performed:
✅ SUCCESS - Operations create pending entries with timestamps
✅ SUCCESS - Previous state stored for rollback
✅ SUCCESS - Operations cleared on successful save
✅ SUCCESS - Rollback restores previous state on save failure
```

### 4. Performance Test
```bash
# Manual testing performed:
✅ SUCCESS - Selectors prevent unnecessary re-renders
✅ SUCCESS - Store updates only affect subscribed components
✅ SUCCESS - No jank during node/edge operations
✅ SUCCESS - Debounced saves work reliably (2 second delay)
```

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria Verification

| Criteria | Status | Evidence |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Store drives canvas updates | ✅ PASS | DiagramCanvas uses store selectors for all state; nodes, edges, and viewport managed by store |
| API sync without jank | ✅ PASS | Debounced saves work smoothly; optimistic updates provide instant feedback; no UI freezing during operations |
| Persist middleware implemented | ✅ PASS | Store uses createJSONStorage with localStorage; viewport and diagramId persist across sessions |
| Selectors for performance | ✅ PASS | 10+ granular selectors prevent unnecessary re-renders; components only subscribe to needed state |
| Optimistic updates work | ✅ PASS | Pending operations tracked with timestamps and previous state; UI responds immediately |
| Rollback on failure | ✅ PASS | Failed saves trigger automatic rollback; previous state restored correctly |

## 🎯 Next Steps

According to `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md`, the next task is:

**Task 011: Custom Node Types — UI Component**
- Create custom React Flow node for UI components
- Implement node properties and handles
- Style with Tailwind and shadcn/ui
- Register node type in canvas

This builds directly on the Zustand store foundation by adding visual node types that will be managed by the store.

## 📦 Version Information

- **Current Version:** 0.1.22
- **Previous Version:** 0.1.21
- **Tasks Completed:** 001-010
- **Phase Progress:** 10/50 tasks in Phase 1 Foundation (20%)

## 🔍 Additional Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **Persist Strategy:** Only viewport and diagramId persist to localStorage to avoid stale state issues with nodes/edges that should always be loaded fresh from the server
- **Operation Tracking:** Each operation gets a unique ID combining type, entity, and timestamp for reliable tracking
- **Selector Pattern:** Granular selectors enable fine-grained component subscriptions and prevent render storms
- **Rollback Design:** Previous state storage enables deterministic rollback without complex operational transformation

### Performance Considerations
- Store updates are optimized to minimize re-renders
- Pending operations stored as Map for O(1) lookup and deletion
- Debounced saves prevent excessive API calls
- localStorage persistence is selective to avoid large payload issues

### Future Enhancements (Not in Scope)
- IndexedDB for offline support (Phase 3)
- Undo/redo history stack (Task 046)
- Real-time collaboration sync (Tasks 071-073)
- Conflict resolution UI (Task 073)

### Database Consistency
✅ All documentation uses `ideagraph-db` database name consistently
✅ No database-related code changes in this task
✅ Database binding remains `next_cf_app` in Cloudflare Workers
