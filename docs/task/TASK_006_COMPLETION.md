```

### 2. Linting Verification
```bash
read_lints for navigation.tsx and dashboard.page.tsx
✅ SUCCESS - No linter errors found after fixing gradient text classes
```

### 3. Component Structure Verification

## 🎯 Next Steps

Based on the implementation plan in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md`, the next task is:

**Task 007: Projects CRUD (Minimal)**
- Priority: High
- Dependencies: [003, 004, 006] ✅ All complete
- Objective: Add basic ability to create and list projects owned by the user
- Files to implement:
  - `src/app/api/projects/route.ts` (POST/GET endpoints)
  - Project form and list components

## 📦 Version Information

- **Current Version:** 0.1.18
- **Previous Version:** 0.1.17
- **Tasks Completed:** 001, 002, 003, 004, 005, 006
- **Phase Progress:** 6/50 tasks in Phase 1 (12%)

## 🔍 Additional Notes

### Design Decisions
1. **Color Scheme**: Used blue/purple gradient theme to establish IdeaGraph's visual identity distinct from the TodoApp template
2. **Navigation Structure**: Flat navigation with Dashboard, Projects, Diagrams as primary links for easy access to core features
3. **Quick Actions**: Three prominent CTAs on dashboard for the most common user workflows (new project, new diagram, import PRD)
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly with hamburger menu for smaller screens (prepared in MobileNavigation component)

### Technical Notes
1. Navigation component required 'use client' directive due to useState hook in MobileNavigation
2. Dashboard page remains server component (async) to support future server-side data fetching
3. All routes link to future pages that will be implemented in subsequent tasks
4. Database naming consistency maintained: `ideagraph-db` (verified in completion document)

### Potential Improvements for Future Tasks
- Add active state indicators for current navigation item
- Implement breadcrumb navigation for nested routes
- Add user profile dropdown in navigation header
- Implement notification bell for collaboration alerts
- Add keyboard shortcuts panel (accessible via ?)
