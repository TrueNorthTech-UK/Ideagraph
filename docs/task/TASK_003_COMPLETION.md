# Task 003 Completion Report

**Task:** Implement Initial Schema (Projects, Diagrams)  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Version:** 0.1.15

---

## 📋 Summary

Task 003 has been successfully completed with all acceptance criteria met. The database schema for projects and diagrams is now fully implemented with demo data seeding capability.

## ✅ Completed Items

### 1. Database Schema
- ✅ Created `projects` table with proper columns
- ✅ Created `diagrams` table with JSON fields for nodes/edges
- ✅ Established foreign key relationships (projects → user, diagrams → projects)
- ✅ Applied migrations to local database

### 2. Demo Data Seeding
- ✅ Created SQL-based seeding script (`scripts/seed-demo.sql`)
- ✅ Implemented idempotent seeding (safe to run multiple times)
- ✅ Added demo user, project, and diagram
- ✅ Included React Flow-compatible node and edge data
- ✅ Added npm scripts for seeding

### 3. Database Management Scripts
- ✅ Fixed all database command scripts to use correct database name (`ideagraph-db`)
- ✅ Added `db:seed:local` command
- ✅ Added `db:seed:prod` command
- ✅ Standardized all database-related scripts in package.json

### 4. Documentation
- ✅ Created `scripts/README.md` with comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Updated task documentation in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md`
- ✅ Updated CHANGELOG.md with version 0.1.15
- ✅ Updated package.json version to 0.1.15

## 🧪 Testing Performed

### 1. Migration Application
```bash
pnpm run db:migrate:local
✅ SUCCESS - All migrations applied
```

### 2. Database Seeding
```bash
pnpm run db:seed:local
✅ SUCCESS - Demo data created:
   - 1 User
   - 1 Project
   - 1 Diagram
```

### 3. Idempotency Test
```bash
pnpm run db:seed:local  # Run again
✅ SUCCESS - No duplicates created (still 1 project, 1 diagram)
```

### 4. Database Inspection
```bash
pnpm run db:inspect:local
✅ SUCCESS - All expected tables exist:
   - user, account, session, verification (auth)
   - projects, diagrams (new)
   - categories, todos (example feature)
```

---

## 📝 Usage Instructions

### Seed Local Database
```bash
# Apply migrations first (if not already done)
pnpm run db:migrate:local

# Seed demo data
pnpm run db:seed:local
```

### View Seeded Data
```bash
# Open Drizzle Studio
pnpm run db:studio:local

# Or query directly
npx wrangler d1 execute ideagraph-db --local --command="SELECT * FROM projects;"
npx wrangler d1 execute ideagraph-db --local --command="SELECT * FROM diagrams;"
```

### Reset and Reseed
```bash
# Reset database (drops tables and reapplies migrations)
pnpm run db:reset:local

# Seed fresh data
pnpm run db:seed:local
```

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria Verification

| Criteria | Status | Evidence |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Tables created with correct columns | ✅ PASS | `projects` and `diagrams` tables exist with proper schema |
| Seeded project and diagram exist | ✅ PASS | Demo data successfully created and verified |
| Idempotent seeding | ✅ PASS | Multiple runs don't create duplicates |
| Database commands work | ✅ PASS | All package.json scripts execute successfully |

## 🎯 Next Steps

With Task 003 complete, the project is ready to proceed to **Task 004: Auth Foundation with Better Auth**.

**Note:** The auth infrastructure (Better Auth, middleware, login/signup pages) already exists in the codebase from the template setup, so Task 004 may require verification and documentation updates rather than new implementation.

## 📦 Version Information

- **Current Version:** 0.1.15
- **Previous Version:** 0.1.14
- **Tasks Completed:** 001, 002, 003
- **Phase Progress:** 3/50 tasks in Phase 1 (6%)

## 🔍 Additional Notes

1. **React Flow Compatibility:** The demo diagram uses React Flow's node and edge format, ensuring compatibility with the future canvas implementation (Tasks 007-015).

2. **Foreign Key Constraints:** All relationships enforce referential integrity with CASCADE delete, ensuring clean data management.

3. **JSON Storage:** Nodes and edges are stored as TEXT fields containing JSON, which is the recommended approach for D1/SQLite. The app will parse these on read.

4. **Production Seeding:** Use `pnpm run db:seed:prod` with caution. Consider creating a separate production-specific seed file if needed.

5. **Demo User:** The demo user (`demo@ideagraph.dev`) has no password. For testing authentication, create a real user through the signup flow.
