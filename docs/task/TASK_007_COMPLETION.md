# Task 007 Completion Report

**Task:** Projects CRUD (Minimal)
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Date:** October 9, 2025
**Version:** 0.1.19

---

## üìã Summary
Implemented basic project management functionality with create and list operations. Users can now create projects owned by their account and view all their projects through a dedicated projects page. This establishes the foundation for organizing diagrams within projects.

## ‚úÖ Completed Items

### 1. API Routes Implementation
- ‚úÖ Created `/api/projects` route with GET and POST methods
- ‚úÖ Implemented authentication checks for all endpoints
- ‚úÖ Added ownership filtering (users only see their own projects)
- ‚úÖ Implemented Zod validation schema for project creation
- ‚úÖ Added proper error handling and status codes

### 2. Projects Page and UI
- ‚úÖ Created `/dashboard/projects` page with authentication protection
- ‚úÖ Built `ProjectsList` component with loading, error, and empty states
- ‚úÖ Implemented `CreateProjectDialog` component with form validation
- ‚úÖ Added responsive grid layout for project cards
- ‚úÖ Integrated toast notifications for user feedback

### 3. Validation and Constants
- ‚úÖ Added PROJECT validation limits to `validation.constant.ts`
- ‚úÖ Name validation: 3-100 characters
- ‚úÖ Description validation: max 500 characters
- ‚úÖ Client and server-side validation consistency

## üß™ Testing Performed

### 1. API Route Testing
```bash
# GET /api/projects - List user's projects
curl http://localhost:3000/api/projects
‚úÖ SUCCESS - Returns authenticated user's projects with count

# POST /api/projects - Create new project
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/projects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test Project","description":"Test Description"}'
‚úÖ SUCCESS - Creates project with UUID and timestamp
```

### 2. Authentication Testing
```bash
# Access without authentication
‚úÖ SUCCESS - Returns 401 Unauthorized when not logged in

# Access with authentication
‚úÖ SUCCESS - Returns user's projects when authenticated
```

### 3. Validation Testing
```bash
# Test minimum name length
‚úÖ SUCCESS - Rejects names shorter than 3 characters

# Test maximum name length
‚úÖ SUCCESS - Rejects names longer than 100 characters

# Test description length
‚úÖ SUCCESS - Rejects descriptions longer than 500 characters
```

### 4. UI Component Testing
```
# Projects Page Load
‚úÖ SUCCESS - Page loads with authentication check
‚úÖ SUCCESS - Redirects to /login when not authenticated

# Create Project Dialog
‚úÖ SUCCESS - Opens dialog on button click
‚úÖ SUCCESS - Form validates required fields
‚úÖ SUCCESS - Shows loading state during submission
‚úÖ SUCCESS - Displays success toast on completion
‚úÖ SUCCESS - Refreshes project list after creation

# Projects List Component
‚úÖ SUCCESS - Shows loading spinner during fetch
‚úÖ SUCCESS - Displays empty state when no projects
‚úÖ SUCCESS - Renders project cards in responsive grid
‚úÖ SUCCESS - Shows formatted dates and descriptions
‚úÖ SUCCESS - Handles errors with retry option
```

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria Verification

| Criteria | Status | Evidence |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Projects can be created | ‚úÖ PASS | API POST endpoint creates projects with validation, UI dialog submits successfully |
| Only user's projects listed | ‚úÖ PASS | GET endpoint filters by ownerId from authenticated session |

## üéØ Next Steps
- Proceed to Task 008: Diagrams CRUD (Minimal) per `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md`
- Implement diagram creation and listing within projects
- Add diagram association with projects

## üì¶ Version Information
- **Current Version:** 0.1.19
- **Previous Version:** 0.1.18
- **Tasks Completed:** 001, 002, 003, 004, 005, 006, 007
- **Phase Progress:** 7/50 tasks in Phase 1 (14%)

## üîç Additional Notes

### Technical Implementation Details
- Used `crypto.randomUUID()` for project ID generation (built-in Node.js, no external dependencies)
- Implemented proper TypeScript types throughout all components
- Followed existing codebase patterns for API routes and components
- Used consistent error handling with try-catch blocks
- Maintained database naming consistency: `ideagraph-db`

### Design Decisions
- Chose Dialog component over full page for project creation (better UX for quick creation)
- Implemented optimistic UI updates with router.refresh() after creation
- Added comprehensive loading and error states for better UX
- Used gradient-themed cards consistent with IdeaGraph branding
- Implemented responsive grid layout (1-2-3 columns based on screen size)

### Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for Task 007)
- Project editing functionality
- Project deletion with confirmation
- Project search and filtering
- Project sharing and permissions
- Project statistics and analytics
