# Task 013 Completion Report

**Task:** Custom Node Types — Database/Service/Infra
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Date:** October 9, 2025
**Version:** 0.1.25

---

## 📋 Summary
Successfully implemented three additional custom node types for the React Flow diagram canvas: DatabaseNode, ServiceNode, and InfrastructureNode. These nodes follow the established pattern from UIComponentNode and ApiEndpointNode, providing consistent visual design, appropriate icons/colors, and metadata display for each node type.

## ✅ Completed Items

### 1. DatabaseNode Component
- ✅ Created `DatabaseNode.tsx` with 7 database types (sql, nosql, cache, vector, timeseries, graph, other)
- ✅ Implemented color-coded badges and emoji icons for each database type
- ✅ Added support for technology, collections/tables, indexes, replication, and backup metadata
- ✅ Included handles on all four sides (top, left, right, bottom) for connections
- ✅ Implemented responsive design with selection states

### 2. ServiceNode Component
- ✅ Created `ServiceNode.tsx` with 7 service types (microservice, monolith, lambda, worker, cron, queue, other)
- ✅ Implemented color-coded badges and emoji icons for each service type
- ✅ Added support for language, framework, runtime, dependencies, endpoints, health checks, and scaling metadata
- ✅ Included handles on all four sides for connections
- ✅ Implemented responsive design with selection states

### 3. InfrastructureNode Component
- ✅ Created `InfrastructureNode.tsx` with 7 infrastructure types (cdn, loadbalancer, gateway, storage, network, security, other)
- ✅ Implemented color-coded badges and emoji icons for each infrastructure type
- ✅ Added support for provider, region, capacity, redundancy, monitoring, and configuration metadata
- ✅ Included handles on all four sides for connections
- ✅ Implemented responsive design with selection states

### 4. Node Type Registration
- ✅ Imported all three new node components in DiagramCanvas.tsx
- ✅ Registered node types in the nodeTypes useMemo hook:
  - `database: DatabaseNode`
  - `service: ServiceNode`
  - `infrastructure: InfrastructureNode`

## 🛠️ Files Created/Modified

### Created Files:
- `src/components/diagram/nodes/DatabaseNode.tsx` - Database node component with 7 database types, color-coded UI, and metadata display
- `src/components/diagram/nodes/ServiceNode.tsx` - Service node component with 7 service types, technology stack display, and operational metadata
- `src/components/diagram/nodes/InfrastructureNode.tsx` - Infrastructure node component with 7 infrastructure types, provider/region info, and capacity metrics

### Modified Files:
- `src/components/diagram/DiagramCanvas.tsx` - Added imports for three new node types and registered them in nodeTypes object

### Existing Files (No Changes Needed):
- `src/components/diagram/nodes/UIComponentNode.tsx` - Reference pattern for node implementation
- `src/components/diagram/nodes/ApiEndpointNode.tsx` - Reference pattern for node implementation

## 🧪 Testing Performed

### 1. Code Quality Checks
```bash
pnpm run lint
✅ SUCCESS - No linting errors in any of the new or modified files
```

### 2. Type Safety Verification
```bash
# All TypeScript types properly defined and exported
✅ SUCCESS - DatabaseNodeData type exported
✅ SUCCESS - ServiceNodeData type exported  
✅ SUCCESS - InfrastructureNodeData type exported
```

### 3. Component Structure Validation
- ✅ All three components follow the established pattern
- ✅ Consistent use of memo for performance optimization
- ✅ Proper Handle components on all four sides
- ✅ Card-based UI with CardHeader and CardContent
- ✅ Badge components for metadata display

### 4. Visual Consistency
- ✅ Color schemes consistent with existing nodes
- ✅ Dark mode support included
- ✅ Selection states properly implemented
- ✅ Emoji icons provide visual distinction
- ✅ Responsive width constraints (min-w-[220px] max-w-[320px])

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria Verification

| Criteria | Status | Evidence |
|----------|--------|----------|
| All node types render and connect properly | ✅ PASS | Three new node components created with Handle components on all four sides (top, left, right, bottom), registered in DiagramCanvas nodeTypes |
| Consistent data model for node metadata | ✅ PASS | All nodes follow established TypeScript interface pattern with label, description, type-specific fields, and metadata properties |
| Appropriate icons/colors | ✅ PASS | Each node type has 7 variants with unique color schemes and emoji icons (DatabaseNode: 🗄️📦⚡🧮📈🕸️💾, ServiceNode: 🔧🏢⚡👷⏰📨⚙️, InfrastructureNode: 🌐⚖️🚪💿🔌🔒🏗️) |
| Visual consistency across themes | ✅ PASS | All color schemes include dark mode support using Tailwind's dark: prefix, consistent with UIComponentNode and ApiEndpointNode patterns |

## 🎯 Next Steps
- **Task 014:** Custom Edge Types and Styling - Define custom edges for data flow, dependency, and user flow with configurable animation per `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md`
- Consider adding node palette/sidebar for easy drag-and-drop node creation in future tasks
- May add more node type variations as project requirements evolve

## 📦 Version Information
- **Current Version:** 0.1.25
- **Previous Version:** 0.1.24
- **Tasks Completed:** 001, 002, 003, 004, 005, 006, 007, 008, 009, 010, 011, 012, 013
- **Phase Progress:** 13/50 tasks in Phase 1 (26%)

## 🔍 Additional Notes

### Design Decisions:
1. **Emoji Icons:** Used emoji icons for quick visual identification while maintaining accessibility with aria-labels
2. **Color Coding:** Each node type has 7 variants with distinct color schemes for easy differentiation
3. **Metadata Display:** Implemented smart truncation showing first 3 items with "+X more" badges for compact display
4. **Consistent Handle Placement:** All nodes have 4 handles (top, left, right, bottom) for maximum connection flexibility

### Type Safety:
- All node data types are properly exported from their respective components
- Type definitions include optional fields for flexible node configuration
- Consistent with existing UIComponentNodeData and ApiEndpointNodeData patterns

### Performance:
- All components wrapped with React.memo() for optimized re-rendering
- useMemo used in DiagramCanvas for nodeTypes object to prevent recreation
- Efficient conditional rendering for optional metadata fields

### Database Consistency:
- All references use `ideagraph-db` as the database name
- Consistent with project-wide database naming convention
