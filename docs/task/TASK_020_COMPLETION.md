## ✅ Acceptance Criteria Verification

| Criteria | Status | Evidence |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Paste and analyze starts request | ✅ PASS | Textarea accepts pasted content, validation checks character count, "Analyze with AI" button triggers POST to `/api/ai/analyze-prd` endpoint with content payload |
| Progress UI updates | ✅ PASS | Animated loading spinner displays during analysis, multi-step progress messages show extraction stages, success state shows results with statistics, error state handles failures gracefully |

## 🎯 Next Steps

With Task 020 complete, the PRD import flow is now functional for text-based input. Users can paste or upload TXT/MD files, trigger AI analysis, and view detailed results.

**Immediate next tasks:**
1. **Task 021** - Export Engine Skeleton: Create the export system architecture
2. **Task 050** - TXT/MD Import Parsing (MVP): Enhanced text parsing
3. **Task 060** - File Upload for PRD Import: Add PDF/DOCX parsing support

**Future enhancements:**
- Convert analysis results directly into diagram nodes/edges
- Save analysis to projects for later diagram generation
- Add analysis history and comparison features
- Implement streaming responses for real-time feedback

## 📦 Version Information

- **Current Version:** 0.1.32
- **Previous Version:** 0.1.31
- **Tasks Completed:** 001-020 (20 tasks)
- **Phase Progress:** 20/50 tasks in Phase 1 (40%)

## 🔍 Additional Notes

### Technical Decisions
1. **Client-side component**: Used `"use client"` directive since page requires React hooks for state management
2. **TypeScript types**: Imported PrdAnalysisResult type from API route for type safety
3. **File reader**: Used native FileReader API for TXT/MD parsing (browser-based, no server upload)
4. **State management**: Used React useState for local component state (no need for Zustand yet)

### UI/UX Decisions
1. **Two-column layout**: Separated input and results for clear visual hierarchy
2. **Progress animation**: Staggered CSS animations create polished loading experience
3. **Statistics cards**: 2x2 grid provides quick overview of analysis results
4. **Action buttons**: Copy and download options give users control over data

### Performance Considerations
- Character counter updates on every keystroke (minimal overhead)
- File upload reads entire file into memory (acceptable for TXT/MD < 100KB)
- Results render without pagination (fine for typical 10-50 entities)

### Accessibility Notes
- Proper semantic HTML with heading hierarchy
- ARIA labels on form inputs
- Color-coded states supplemented with icons
- Keyboard navigation fully functional

### Known Limitations
1. File upload limited to TXT and MD formats (PDF/DOCX coming in Tasks 050/060)
2. No streaming responses yet (entire analysis completes before display)
3. No direct diagram generation from results (requires canvas integration)
4. No analysis history or comparison features yet

### Database Integration
- Analysis results automatically saved to `import_sessions` table via API
- Session ID included in response metadata for future reference
- Import history accessible for future audit/replay features

**Task 020: COMPLETE ✅**

The PRD Import UI provides a complete foundation for document-based architecture analysis. Users can now paste or upload PRD content, trigger AI analysis with visual feedback, and review detailed results with actionable insights. The interface is responsive, accessible, and integrates seamlessly with existing API endpoints and database persistence.
