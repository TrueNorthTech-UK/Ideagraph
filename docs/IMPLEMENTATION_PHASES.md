# Implementation Phases

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
- **Tasks:** 001–050
- **Objectives:** Project setup, auth, DB schema, basic React Flow canvas, export skeleton, initial AI route and agent scaffolding
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Deliverables:** Running app with auth-protected dashboard, projects/diagrams minimal CRUD, canvas rendering, export engine baseline
- **Testing Requirements:** Smoke tests for routes, API validation, export unit tests
- **Risk Assessment:** D1 migration quirks; React Flow SSR boundaries; mitigate with local mocks and CSR islands

## Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 4-6)
- **Tasks:** 051–120
- **Objectives:** Dashboard UX, project management UI, chat UI, message streaming, context management, responsive design
- **Dependencies:** Phase 1 complete
- **Deliverables:** Usable dashboard with projects/diagrams flows, chat panel integrated with AI endpoints
- **Testing Requirements:** Component tests for chat, integration tests for API routes
- **Risk Assessment:** Streaming on edge; mitigate via tested fetch streaming patterns

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 7-9)
- **Tasks:** 121–180
- **Objectives:** Group/container nodes, real-time collaboration (Durable Objects), export enhancements, AI recommendations and conflict resolution, auto-layout
- **Dependencies:** Phase 2
- **Deliverables:** Collaborative editing with presence/cursor sync, advanced nodes/edges, robust exports
- **Testing Requirements:** WebSocket integration tests, snapshot tests for exports
- **Risk Assessment:** Realtime consistency; mitigate by periodic snapshots and server authority

## Phase 4: Production Polish (Weeks 10-12)
- **Tasks:** 181–230
- **Objectives:** Performance, error handling, testing coverage, documentation, deployment, monitoring
- **Dependencies:** Phase 3
- **Deliverables:** Production-ready app with monitoring and deployment checklist satisfied
- **Testing Requirements:** E2E flows, performance benchmarks, error path coverage
- **Risk Assessment:** Performance regressions; mitigate with profiling and thresholds
